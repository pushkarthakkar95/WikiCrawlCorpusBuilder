The 2015–16 Premier League known as the Barclays Premier League for sponsorship reasons was the 24th season of the Premier League the top English professional league for association football clubs since its establishment in 1992 The season began on 8 August 2015 and was scheduled to conclude on 15 May 20166 However the Manchester United vs Bournemouth fixture was postponed to 17 May 2016 on the final day due to a suspicious package inside Old Trafford7
Chelsea began the season as defending champions of the 2014–15 season Bournemouth Watford and Norwich City entered as the three promoted teams from the 2014–15 Football League Championship
Leicester City won the championship for the first time in their 132year history becoming the 24th club to become English football champions and the sixth club to win the Premier League Many commentators consider this to be one of the greatest sports shocks in history especially considering that Leicester spent half of the previous season at the bottom of the table before finishing 14th
Leicester City were the surprise of the season Following their late escape from relegation in the previous season many pundits had predicted that they would be relegated8 and bookmakers gave 5000–1 odds on them winning the title9 After the dismissal of manager Nigel Pearson they began the new season with Italian Claudio Ranieri in charge Pearson had been known for his short temper with the press while Ranieri has a reputation for good humour10 The appointment was met with scepticism by pundits including Leicester fan and former player Gary Lineker as Ranieri had recently been sacked from his previous post as manager of the Greek national team after suffering a humiliating defeat to the Faroe Islands in his last game in charge1011
Despite winning their opening game against Sunderland and topping the table they dropped back following a 5–2 defeat by Arsenal in September12 However aided by Jamie Vardys record feat of scoring in eleven consecutive Premier League games1 they then remained unbeaten – and returned to the top of the table – until 26 December when a 1–0 defeat by Liverpool dropped them to second place They returned to the top after a 1–1 draw with Aston Villa on 16 January and remained there for the rest of the season12 Following the Stamford Bridge 2–2 draw between Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur on 2 May 2016 and having two more games to play Leicester City were confirmed champions their first title in the top flight of English football eclipsing the runnersup spot they reached in 19299
Defending champions Chelsea sacked manager José Mourinho in December while in 16th place and eventually failed to qualify for European football for the first time in two decades Eden Hazard the previous seasons PFA Players Player of the Year did not score a league goal until late April13 They eventually finished 10th set a thenrecord lowest finish for a Premier League title holders They broke the jointrecord of 7th set by Blackburn Rovers in 1995–96 and Manchester United in 2013–1414 This record only stood for one year as Leicester City finished 12th the following season
Arsenal looking for their first title since 2004 and following a poor start improved and in early January took the top spot from Leicester However a poor run of results including draws with Liverpool15 Stoke16 and Southampton17 and a loss to Chelsea18 saw them drop to fourth by midFebruary They remained in contention but draws with West Ham19 Sunderland20 and Crystal Palace21 in April saw their title hopes vanish
Meanwhile their London rivals Tottenham Hotspur won six matches in a row and when Arsenal lost to Manchester United at the end of February Tottenham leapfrogged them into second place22 where they remained until the final weekend of the season Draws with West Bromwich Albion23 and Chelsea stopped them winning their first title since 1961 The game in which Tottenhams title challenge ended was their 2–2 draw at Chelsea on 2 May with many altercations between players and benches on and off the field especially after Eden Hazard scored the equalizing and final goal24 Mark Clattenburg who refereed the game subsequently stated that he could have sent three players off from Tottenham but chose instead to allow them to play on giving the team a total of nine yellow cards a league record so as to allow them to self destruct and have no one else to blame but themselves2526
After a 2–1 home loss to Southampton and a 5–1 defeat away to Newcastle United in their final two matches Tottenham ended the season in third place one point behind Arsenal27
Aston Villa a presence in the Premier League since the leagues foundation in 1992 and present in the top division since the 1988–89 season were the first team to be mathematically relegated after a 1–0 loss at Manchester United on 16 April28 On 11 May Sunderland won 3–0 against Everton a result which relegated Newcastle United and Norwich City with one game remaining29
All of the final fixtures of the season were scheduled for 15 May and to kick off at the same time However Manchester Uniteds home game against Bournemouth was postponed for a future date after Old Trafford was evacuated because of the discovery of a suspicious device which was destroyed in a controlled explosion It was confirmed to be an accidental leftover from a training exercise30
The unlikely nature of Leicesters title led to a flood of coverage from across the globe Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted his congratulations saying it was An extraordinary thoroughly deserved Premier League title Congratulations were also sent by the Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi who praised his compatriot Ranieri31
Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore described it as biggest story weve ever had in English football32 Former Leicester manager Martin ONeill described it as the greatest achievement of this century32 Gary Lineker the former Leicester striker who led a consortium that saved the club from administration in 2002 had said he would host the BBC football show Match of the Day in his underwear if Leicester won the title332 After they won the title he said There were no odds that I would have taken at the start of the season No odds You could have given me 10 million to one and Id have said Nah its a waste of a quid34 José Mourinho manager of 2015 champions Chelsea and Ranieris replacement at the same team eleven years earlier sent his congratulations saying I lost my title to Claudio Ranieri and it is with incredible emotion that I live this magic moment in his career35 Ranieri said after winning his first title at the age of 64 that he wouldnt have appreciated it as a young man Now I am an old man I can feel it much better3536
The long odds bookmakers had given Leicester at the start of the season led to them incurring losses of up to £25 million with one punter winning over £100000 having wagered £20 at the original 5000–1 odds37 the largest payout was £200000 to an anonymous bettor who wagered £100 on the team in October when the odds were improved to 2000–138
Superstitious claims of phenomena helping Leicester win the league include the clubs Thai owners employing Buddhist monks to bless the players31 and the reburial of King Richard III in the citys cathedral in March 201539
Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship The promoted teams were Bournemouth playing in the top flight for the first time ever Watford returning to the top flight after eight years and Norwich City returning after a seasons absence They replaced Hull City ending their twoyear spell in the top flight Burnley and Queens Park Rangers both teams relegated after a seasons presence

The Premier League often referred to as the English Premier League or the EPL outside England is the top level of the English football league system Contested by 20 clubs it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League EFL Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches playing all 19 other teams both home and away1 Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons
The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League founded in 1888 and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal2 The deal was worth around £1 billion a year domestically as of 2013–14 with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively3 The league is a corporation in which the member clubs act as shareholders and generates €22 billion per year in domestic and international television rights4 Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £24 billion in 2016–17 with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to English Football League EFL clubs5
The Premier League is the mostwatched sports league in the world broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 47 billion people67 For the 2018–19 season average Premier League match attendance was at 381818 second to the Bundesligas 435009 while aggregated attendance across all matches is the highest of any league at 1450898110 Most stadium occupancies are near capacity11 The Premier League ranks second in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons as of 2019 only behind Spains La Liga12
Fortynine clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992 fortyseven English and two Welsh clubs Six of them have won the title Manchester United 13 Chelsea 5 Manchester City 4 Arsenal 3 Blackburn Rovers 1 and Leicester City 1 The record of most points in a Premier League season is 100 set by Manchester City in 2017–18
Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s the late 1980s marked a low point for English football Stadiums were crumbling supporters endured poor facilities hooliganism was rife and English clubs were banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 198513 The Football League First Division the top level of English football since 1888 was behind leagues such as Italys Serie A and Spains La Liga in attendances and revenues and several top English players had moved abroad14
By the turn of the 1990s the downward trend was starting to reverse At the 1990 FIFA World Cup England reached the semifinals UEFA European footballs governing body lifted the fiveyear ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990 resulting in Manchester United lifting the UEFA Cup Winners Cup in 1991 The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards which proposed expensive upgrades to create allseater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster was published in January 199015
In the 1980s major English clubs had begun to transform into business ventures applying commercial principles to club administration to maximise revenue Martin Edwards of Manchester United Irving Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur and David Dein of Arsenal were among the leaders in this transformation16 The commercial imperative led to the top clubs seeking to increase their power and revenue the clubs in Division One threatened to break away from the Football League and in so doing they managed to increase their voting power and gain more favourable financial arrangement taking a 50 share of all television and sponsorship income in 198616 They demanded that television companies should pay more for their coverage of football matches17 and revenue from television grew in importance The Football League received £63 million for a twoyear agreement in 1986 but by 1988 in a deal agreed with ITV the price rose to £44 million over four years with the leading clubs taking 75 of the cash1819 According to Scholar who was involved in the negotiations of television deals each of the First Division clubs received only around £25000 per year from television rights before 1986 this increased to around £50000 in the 1986 negotiation then to £600000 in 198820 The 1988 negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a super league but they were eventually persuaded to stay with the top clubs taking the lions share of the deal182122 The negotiations also convinced the bigger clubs that in order to receive enough votes they needed to take the whole of First Division with them instead of a smaller super league23 By the beginning of the 1990s the big clubs again considered breaking away especially now that they had to fund the cost of stadium upgrade as proposed by the Taylor Report24
In 1990 the managing director of London Weekend Television LWT Greg Dyke met with the representatives of the big five football clubs in England Manchester United Liverpool Tottenham Everton and Arsenal over a dinner25 The meeting was to pave the way for a break away from The Football League26 Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money27 The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it however the league would have no credibility without the backing of The Football Association and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea The FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the Football Leagues position28 The FA released a report in June 1991 Blueprint for the Future of Football that supported the plan for Premier League with FA the ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league23
At the close of the 1991 season a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall The Founder Members Agreement signed on 17 July 1991 by the games topflight clubs established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League29 The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe14 Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League Dyke and ITV would lose out in the bidding for broadcast rights as BSkyB won with a bid of £304 million over five years with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day2527
In 1992 the First Division clubs resigned from the Football League en masse and on 27 May 1992 the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company working out of an office at the Football Associations then headquarters in Lancaster Gate14 This meant a breakup of the 104yearold Football League that had operated until then with four divisions the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three There was no change in competition format the same number of teams competed in the top flight and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted22
The league held its first season in 1992–93 It was composed of 22 clubs for that season The first Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2–1 win against Manchester United30 The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were Arsenal Aston Villa Blackburn Rovers Chelsea Coventry City Crystal Palace Everton Ipswich Town Leeds United Liverpool Manchester City Manchester United Middlesbrough Norwich City Nottingham Forest Oldham Athletic Queens Park Rangers Sheffield United Sheffield Wednesday Southampton Tottenham Hotspur and Wimbledon31 Luton Town Notts County and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old first division at the end of the 1991–92 season and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season32
One significant feature of the Premier League in the mid2000s was the dominance of the socalled Top Four clubs Arsenal Chelsea Liverpool and Manchester United3334 During this decade they dominated the top four spots which came with UEFA Champions League qualification taking all topfour places in 5 out of 6 seasons from 2003–04 to 2008–09 inclusive while every season during the 2000s saw the Big Four always qualifying for European competition Following the 2003–04 season Arsenal acquired the nickname The Invincibles as they became the first club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game the only time it has ever happened in the Premier League3536
During the 2000s only four sides outside the Top Four managed to qualify for the Champions League Leeds United 1999–2000 Newcastle United 2001–02 and 2002–03 Everton 2004–05 and Tottenham Hotspur 2009–10 – each occupying the final Champions League spot with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season who finished third
In May 2008 Kevin Keegan stated that Top Four dominance threatened the division This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world37 Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether youre at the top in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting38
Between 2005 and 2012 there was a Premier League representative in seven of the eight Champions League finals with only Top Four clubs reaching that stage Liverpool 2005 Manchester United 2008 and Chelsea 2012 won the competition during this period with Arsenal 2006 Liverpool 2007 Chelsea 2008 and Manchester United 2009 and 2011 all losing Champions League finals39 Leeds United were the only nonTop Four side to reach the semifinals of the Champions League in the 2000–01 season
Additionally between the 1999–2000 and 2009–10 seasons four Premier League sides reached UEFA Cup or Europa League finals with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in 2001 Arsenal 2000 Middlesbrough 2006 and Fulham 2010 all lost their finals40
Although the groups dominance was reduced to a degree after this period with the emergence of Manchester City and Tottenham in terms of all time Premier League points won they remain clear by some margin As of the end of the 2018–19 season – the 27th season of the Premier League – Liverpool in fourth place in the alltime points table were over 250 points ahead of the next team Tottenham Hotspur They are also the only teams to maintain a winning average of over 50 throughout their entire Premier League tenures41
The years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the Top Four with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City both breaking into the top four places on a regular basis turning the Top Four into the Big Six42 In the 2009–10 season Tottenham finished fourth and became the first team to break the top four since Everton five years prior43 Criticism of the gap between an elite group of super clubs and the majority of the Premier League has continued nevertheless due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs44 Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season becoming the first club outside the Big Four to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season That season also saw two of the Big Four Chelsea and Liverpool finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season42
With only four UEFA Champions League qualifying places available in the league greater competition for qualification now exists albeit from a narrow base of six clubs If the teams are level on points and goal difference play off for UEFA Champions League spots will be played in neutral ground In the following five seasons after the 2011–12 campaign Manchester United and Liverpool both found themselves outside of the top four three times while Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015–16 season Arsenal finished 5th in 2016–17 ending their record run of 20 consecutive topfour finishes45
In the 2015–16 season the top four was breached by a nonBig Six side for the first time since Everton in 2005 Leicester City were the surprise winners of the league qualifying for the Champions League as a result46
Off the pitch the Big Six wield significant financial power and influence with these clubs arguing that they should be entitled to a greater share of revenue due to the greater stature of their clubs globally and the attractive football they aim to play47 Objectors argue that the egalitarian revenue structure in the Premier League helps to maintain a competitive league which is vital for its future success48
The 2016–17 Deloitte Football Money League report showed the financial disparity between the Big Six and the rest of the division All of the Big Six had revenues greater than €350 million with Manchester United having the largest revenue in the league at €6763 million Leicester City was the closest club to the Big Six in terms of revenue recording a figure of €2711 million for that season – helped by participation in the Champions League The eighth largest revenue generator West Ham who didnt play in European competition had revenues of €2133 million nearly half of the club with the fifth largest revenue Liverpool €4242 million49 A substantial part of the clubs revenue by then came from television broadcast deals with the biggest clubs each taking from around £150 million to nearly £200 million in the 2016–17 season from such deals50 In Deloittes 2019 report all of the Big Six were in the top ten of the worlds richest clubs51
The number of clubs was reduced to 20 down from 22 in 1995 when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted5253 The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991–92 season – the year prior to the formation of the Premier League53
On 8 June 2006 FIFA requested that all major European leagues including Italys Serie A and Spains La Liga be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007–08 season The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction54 Ultimately the 2007–08 season kicked off again with 20 teams55
The league changed its name from the FA Premier League to simply the Premier League in 200756
From the 201920 season video assistant referees were used in the league57
The Football Association Premier League Ltd FAPL585960 is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs Each club is a shareholder with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts The clubs elect a chairman chief executive and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league61 The Football Association is not directly involved in the daytoday operations of the Premier League but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league62
The current chairman is Sir Dave Richards who was appointed in April 1999 and the chief executive is Richard Scudamore appointed in November 199963 The former chairman and chief executive John Quinton and Peter Leaver were forced to resign in March 1999 after awarding consultancy contracts to former Sky executives Sam Chisholm and David Chance64 Rick Parry was the leagues first chief executive65 On 13 November 2018 Susanna Dinnage was announced as Scudamores successor due to start in early 201966
The Premier League sends representatives to UEFAs European Club Association the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients For the 2012–13 season the Premier League has 10 representatives in the Association Arsenal Aston Villa Chelsea Everton Fulham Liverpool Manchester City Manchester United Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur67 The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFAs Club Competitions Committee which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League68
There are 20 clubs in the Premier League During the course of a season from August to May each club plays the others twice a double roundrobin system once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents for 38 games Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw No points are awarded for a loss Teams are ranked by total points then goal difference and then goals scored If still equal teams are deemed to occupy the same position If there is a tie for the championship for relegation or for qualification to other competitions a playoff match at a neutral venue decides rank69
A system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League70 with an additional team promoted after a series of playoffs involving the third fourth fifth and sixth placed clubs71 The Premier League had 22 teams when it began in 1992 but this was reduced to the present 20team format in 199553
49 clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992 up to and including the 2018–19 season72
The following 20 clubs are competing in the Premier League during the 2019–20 season
a Founding member of the Premier League b Never been relegated from Premier League c One of the original 12 Football League teams


The following clubs are not competing in the Premier League during the 2019–20 season but have previously competed in the Premier League for at least one season
a Founding member of the Premier League b One of the original 12 Football League teams c Club based in Wales
In 2011 a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time after Swansea City gained promotion7374 The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea Citys home match at the Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 201175 The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two in 2013–14 as Cardiff City gained promotion76 but they were relegated after their maiden season77 Cardiff were promoted again in 2017–18 but the number of Welsh clubs remained the same for the 2018–19 Premier League season as Swansea City were relegated from the Premier League in 2017–1878 Following Cardiff Citys relegation in 2018–19 there are currently no Welsh clubs participating in the Premier League79
Because they are members of the Football Association of Wales FAW the question of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused longrunning discussions in UEFA Swansea took one of Englands three available places in the Europa League in 2013–14 by winning the League Cup in 2012–1380 The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012 allowing them to participate81
Participation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs has sometimes been discussed but without result The idea came closest to reality in 1998 when Wimbledon received Premier League approval to relocate to Dublin Ireland but the move was blocked by the Football Association of Ireland82838485 Additionally the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotlands two biggest teams Celtic and Rangers should or will take part in the Premier League but nothing has come of these discussions86
The top four teams in the Premier League qualify for the subsequent seasons UEFA Champions League group stage The winners of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League also qualify for the subsequent seasons UEFA Champions League group stage If this means six Premier League teams qualify then the fourthplaced team in the Premier League instead plays in the UEFA Europa League as any single nation is limited to a maximum of 5 teams
The fifthplaced team in the Premier League as well as the winner of the FA Cup qualifies for the subsequent seasons UEFA Europa League group stage but if the winner also finished in the top five places in the Premier League or has won one of UEFAs major tournaments then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth The winner of the EFL Cup qualifies for the subsequent seasons UEFA Europa League second qualifying round but if the winner already qualified for a UEFA competition via their performance in another competition then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in the Premier League or seventh if the FA Cup result already caused the sixthplaced team to qualify87
The number of places allocated to English clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position a country holds in the UEFA country coefficients which are calculated based upon the performance of teams in UEFA competitions in the previous five years Currently the ranking of England and de facto the Premier League is 2nd behind Spain
An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005 after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League giving England five qualifiers89 UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing However for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league it would qualify at the expense of the fourthplaced team in the league At that time no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League90 This occurred in 2012 when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League that summer but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur who went into the Europa League91
From 2015–16 the Europa League winners qualify for the Champions League increasing the maximum number of participants per country to five92 This took effect in England in 2016–17 when Manchester United finished sixth in the Premier League and won the Europa League giving England five Champions League entrants for 2017–1893 In these instances any Europa League berth vacated will not be handed down to the nextbest Premier League finisher outside a qualifying place and so the associations Europa League entrants for the following season will be reduced If it happens that both Champions League and Europa League winners are of the same association and both finish outside the top four then the fourthplaced team will be transferred to the Europa League
Between the 1992–93 and the 2018–19 seasons Premier League clubs won the UEFA Champions League five times and had seven runnersup behind Spains La Liga with eleven wins level with Italys Serie A and ahead of among others Germanys Bundesliga with three wins39 The FIFA Club World Cup originally called the FIFA Club World Championship has been won twice by a Premier League club Manchester United in 2008 and Liverpool in 201994 with two runnersup Liverpool in 2005 and Chelsea in 20129596 behind Spains La Liga with seven wins97 Brazils Brasileirão with four wins95969899 and tied with Italys Serie A with two wins100101
From 1993 to 2016 the Premier League had title sponsorship rights sold to two companies which were Carling brewery and Barclays Bank PLC Barclays was the most recent title sponsor having sponsored the Premier League from 2001 until 2016 until 2004 the title sponsorship was held through its Barclaycard brand before shifting to its main banking brand in 2004102
Barclays deal with the Premier League expired at the end of the 2015–16 season The FA announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League arguing that they wanted to build a clean brand for the competition more in line with those of major US sports leagues104
As well as sponsorship for the league itself the Premier League has a number of official partners and suppliers105 The official ball supplier for the league is Nike who have had the contract since the 2000–01 season when they took over from Mitre106 Under its Merlin brand Topps held the licence to produce collectables for the Premier League between 1994 and 2019 including stickers for their sticker album and trading cards107 Launched in the 2007–08 season Topps’ Match Attax the official Premier League trading card game is the best selling boys collectable in the UK and is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world107108 In October 2018 Panini were awarded the licence to produce collectables from the 2019–20 season109 Since 2017 the chocolate company Cadbury is the official snack partner of the Premier League and sponsors the Premier League Golden Boot and Premier League Golden Glove awards110
The Premier League has the highest revenue of any football league in the world with total club revenues of €248 billion in 2009–10111112 In 2013–14 due to improved television revenues and cost controls the Premier League had net profits in excess of £78 million exceeding all other football leagues113 In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queens Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdoms broadcasting industry114
The Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world Deloittes Football Money League listed seven Premier League clubs in the top 20 for the 2009–10 season115 and all 20 clubs were in the top 40 globally by the end of the 2013–14 season largely as a result of increased broadcasting revenue116 From 2013 the league generates €22 billion per year in domestic and international television rights4
Premier League clubs agreed in principle in December 2012 to radical new cost controls The two proposals consist of a breakeven rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season With the new television deals on the horizon momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents117
Central payments for the 2016–17 season amounted to £2398515773 across the 20 clubs with each team receiving a flat participation fee of £35301989 and additional payments for TV broadcasts £1016690 for general UK rights to match highlights £1136083 for each live UK broadcast of their games and £39090596 for all overseas rights commercial rights a flat fee of £4759404 and a notional measure of merit which was based upon final league position5 The merit component was a nominal sum of £1941609 multiplied by each finishing place counted from the foot of the table eg Burnley finished 16th in May 2017 five places counting upwards and received 5 × £1941609  £9708045 merit payment5
Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League The Leagues decision to assign broadcasting rights to BSkyB in 1992 was at the time a radical decision but one that has paid off At the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market as was charging fans to watch live televised football However a combination of Skys strategy the quality of Premier League football and the publics appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier Leagues TV rights soar19
The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis This is in contrast to some other European Leagues including La Liga in which each club sells its rights individually leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs118 The money is divided into three parts119 half is divided equally between the clubs one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club and equal steps all the way down the table the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs120
The first Sky television rights agreement was worth £304 million over five seasons121 The next contract negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season rose to £670 million over four seasons121 The third contract was a £1024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 to 2002 to 2003–04 The league brought in £320 million from the sale of its international rights for the threeyear period from 2004 to 2005 to 2006–07 It sold the rights itself on a territorybyterritory basis122 Skys monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company Sky and Setanta paid £17 billion a twothirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons on Match of the Day for £1716 million a 63 per cent increase on the £105 million it paid for the previous threeyear period123 Sky and BT have agreed to jointly pay £843 million for delayed television rights to 242 games that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 pm on matchday124 Overseas television rights fetched £625 million nearly double the previous contract125 The total raised from these deals is more than £27 billion giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40 millionayear from 2007 to 2010126
The TV rights agreement between the Premier League and Sky has faced accusations of being a cartel and a number of court cases have arisen as a result127 An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position128 In July 1999 the Premier Leagues method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court who concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest129
The BBCs highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights as well as other evenings when fixtures justify will run until 2016130 Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 have been purchased for £1782 billion131 On 22 June 2009 due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £30 million payment to the Premier League ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010 to 2011 to 2012–13132 On 13 June 2012 the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013–14 through 2015–16 seasons at £246 millionayear The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky who paid £760 millionayear The total domestic rights have raised £3018 billion an increase of 702 over the 2010–11 to 2012–13 rights133 The value of the licensing deal rose by another 702 in 2015 when Sky and BT paid £5136 billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018–19 season134

There has been an increasing gulf between the Premier League and the Football League Since its split with the Football League many established clubs in the Premier League have managed to distance themselves from their counterparts in lower leagues Owing in large part to the disparity in revenue from television rights between the leagues149 many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in the Premier League In every season except 2001–02 2011–12 and 2017–18 at least one Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League In 1997–98 all three promoted clubs were relegated at the end of the season150
The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue to clubs that are relegated from the league in the form of parachute payments Starting with the 2013–14 season these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons151 Though designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues the average Premier League team receives £41 million152 while the average Football League Championship club receives £2 million153 critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not154 leading to the common occurrence of teams bouncing back soon after their relegation For some clubs who have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League financial problems including in some cases administration or even liquidation have followed Further relegations down the footballing ladder have ensued for several clubs unable to cope with the gap155156
As of the 2017–18 season Premier League football has been played in 58 stadiums since the formation of the division157 The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished As a result all stadiums in the Premier League are allseater158159 Since the formation of the Premier League football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities with some clubs moving to newbuild stadiums160 Nine stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished The stadiums for the 2017–18 season show a large disparity in capacity For example Wembley Stadium the temporary home of Tottenham Hotspur has a capacity of 90000 while Dean Court the home of Bournemouth has a capacity of 11360161162 The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2017–18 season is 806033 with an average capacity of 40302161
Stadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs163 For the 2016–17 season average attendances across the league clubs were 35838 for Premier League matches with an aggregate attendance of 13618596164 This represents an increase of 14712 from the average attendance of 21126 recorded in the Premier Leagues first season 1992–93165 However during the 1992–93 season the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Reports 1994–95 deadline for allseater stadiums166167 The Premier Leagues record average attendance of 36144 was set during the 2007–08 season168 This record was then beaten in the 2013–14 season recording an average attendance of 36695 with an attendance of just under 14 million the highest average in Englands top flight since 1950169
Managers in the Premier League are involved in the daytoday running of the team including the training team selection and player acquisition Their influence varies from clubtoclub and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans170 Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available and follows the completion of the UEFA B and A Licences171 The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis ie more than 12 weeks the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control172 Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker including Paul Hart at Portsmouth and David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur
Arsène Wenger is the longestserving manager having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League from 1996 to his retirement at the conclusion of the 2017–18 season and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828 all with Arsenal He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson who had managed 810 matches with Manchester United from the Premier Leagues inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League173
During the 2019–20 season 6 managers have been sacked as of 28 December Javi Gracia and Quique Sánchez Flores of Watford Mauricio Pochettino of Tottenham Hotspur Unai Emery of Arsenal Marco Silva of Everton and Manuel Pellegrini of West Ham United
There have been several studies into the reasoning behind and effects of managerial sackings Most famously Professor Sue Bridgewater of the University of Liverpool and Dr Bas ter Weel of the University of Amsterdam performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings Bridgewaters study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match174
At the inception of the Premier League in 1992–93 just 11 players named in the starting lineups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland176 By 2000–01 the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36 of the total In the 2004–05 season the figure had increased to 45 On 26 December 1999 Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting lineup177 and on 14 February 2005 Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16man squad for a match178 By 2009 under 40 of the players in the Premier League were English179 By February 2020 117 different nationalities had played in the Premier League and 101 nationalities had scored in the competition180
In response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players in 1999 the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union181 A nonEU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive A team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years If a player does not meet those criteria the club wishing to sign him may appeal182
Players may only be transferred during transfer windows that are set by the Football Association The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA usually on an emergency basis183 As of the 2010–11 season the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25man squad of players aged over 21 with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances184185 This was to enable the home grown rule to be enacted whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25man squad to be homegrown players184
There is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League when the average player wage was £75000 per year186 In the 2018–19 season the average annual salary stood at £299 million
The total salary bill for the 20 Premier League clubs in the 2018–19 was £162bn this compares to £105bn in La Liga £083bn in Serie A £072bn in Bundesliga and £054bn in Ligue 1 The club with the highest average wages is Manchester United at £65m This is smaller than the club with the highest wage bill in Spain Barcelona £105m and Italy Juventus £67m but higher than in Germany Bayern Munich £64m and France Paris St Germain 61m
The ratio of the wages of the highest paid team to lowest paid in the Premier League is 682 to 1 This is much lower than in La Liga 191 to 1 Serie A 16 to 1 Bundesliga 205 to 1 and Ligue 1 266 to 1 Because of the lower differential between team wage bills in the Premier League it is often regarded as being more competitive than other top European leagues187
The record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition Prior to the start of the first Premier League season Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than £3 million188 The record has increased steadily and Philippe Coutinho is now the most expensive transfer involving a Premier League club at £106 million The highest transfer fee paid by a Premier League club is £89 million for Paul Pogba

The 1992–93 FA Premier League was the inaugural season of the Premier League the top division of English football The season began on 15 August 1992 and ended on 11 May 1993 The league was made up of the 22 clubs that broke away from The Football League at the end of the 1991–92 season The new league was backed up by a fiveyear £305 million deal with Sky to televise Premier League matches In concept the Premier League was identical to the old First Division of the Football League which was now reduced to three divisions
In May 1992 the breakaway league signed a broadcasting rights contract with Sky and the BBC valued at £304 million the largest such agreement in the history of British sport2 The leagues executive committee was unable however to secure title sponsorship for the new competition after eight clubs blocked a proposed £13 million deal with brewers Bass3 Nonetheless clubs began to utilise their dramatically increased wealth to fund a series of highprofile transfers4
Although the idea of a super league had been mentioned by footballs governing bodies and evaluated by the media since the mid 1980s plans for a new Premier League of 22 clubs were first unveiled by the Football Association in October 1990 and included in the Football Associations Blueprint for the Future of Football published in June 19915 The majority of First Division clubs particularly longestablished top clubs including Arsenal and Manchester United were in favour of a breakaway from the Football League although Football League president Bill Fox criticised the planned Premier League as an attempt by the Football Association to hijack the First Division
Shortly before the season began newly promoted Blackburn Rovers signed Southamptons 21yearold England international striker Alan Shearer for a new British record fee variously reported as £33 million6 £34 million7 or £36 million8 Several other players moved for fees of £2 million or more including Arsenals David Rocastle who joined Leeds United9 Dean Saunders who moved from Liverpool to Aston Villa10 and Teddy Sheringham who left Nottingham Forest for Tottenham Hotspur11
The structure of the new league was identical to that of the previous seasons Football League First Division comprising 22 teams with each playing the other 21 twice for a total of 42 matches Ipswich Town and Middlesbrough had been promoted from the old Second Division as champions and runnersup respectively and Blackburn Rovers took the third promotion place after winning the 1991–92 Second Division playoff12
The first Premier League title went to Manchester United the clubs first title for 26 years Their title was achieved with a 10point lead over runnersup Aston Villa Norwich City led the table for much of the season but their challenge faded in the final weeks of the season and were out of contention three games before the season was over after they lost 3–1 to Ipswich Town Norwich did however finish in third place achieving European qualification in Mike Walkers debut season as manager Blackburn in the top division for the first time in almost 30 years finished in fourth place also taking the lead of the league early in the season but suffering a shortage of goals after 16goal Alan Shearer was injured just after Christmas The title race after Christmas was largely between the clubs who finished in the top four after early challenges from the likes of Arsenal Coventry City and QPR were not sustained
Nottingham Forests league form had suffered through the sale of key players like Des Walker and Teddy Sheringham and they were bottom of the Premier League for much of the 1992–93 season Their relegation was confirmed in early May when they lost to Sheffield United and manager Brian Clough announced his retirement after 18 years as manager which had yielded one league title two European Cups and four League Cups Next to go were newly promoted Middlesbrough who fell from midtable at Christmas to go down in second from bottom place Last to go down were Crystal Palace who failed to win their final game of the season which would have instead consigned Oldham Athletic to the final relegation place  Oldhams survival was secured with a thrilling 43 win over Southampton13deprecated source
Title holders Leeds United finished 17th which became one of the worstever title defences in the English top flight and failed to win a single away game in the league all season14
The top scorer in the new Premier League was Teddy Sheringham who found the net for Nottingham Forest in their opening game of the season before being sold to Tottenham Hotspur scoring a further 21 goals for the North London side in the league PFA Player of the Year was Paul McGrath of Aston Villa FWA Player of the Year was Chris Waddle who helped Sheffield Wednesday achieve runnersup spot in both of the cups after ending his threeyear spell in France PFA Young Player of the Year was Ryan Giggs who won the award for the second year running and also picked up a league title medal with Manchester United
Twentytwo teams competed in the league – the top nineteen teams from the First Division and the three teams promoted from the Second Division The promoted teams were Ipswich Town Middlesbrough and Blackburn Rovers returning to the top flight after an absence of six three and twentysix years respectively They replaced Luton Town Notts County and West Ham United ending their top flight spells of ten one and eleven years respectively
as of 9 May 1993
The top goalscorer in the Premier Leagues inaugural season was Teddy Sheringham who scored one goal for Nottingham Forest before his earlyseason transfer followed by 21 for Tottenham Hotspur for a total of 2215 Alan Shearer had scored 16 goals by Christmas before suffering a seasonending injury
The Professional Footballers Association PFA presented its annual Players Player of the Year award to Paul McGrath a veteran central defender who contributed to Aston Villas secondplace finish in the Premier League Manchester Uniteds Paul Ince came second and Blackburns Alan Shearer third32 The Young Player of the Year award was given to Ryan Giggs the 19yearold Manchester United left winger who had also won the award in the previous season Giggs who finished ahead of Tottenhams Nick Barmby and Nottingham Forests Roy Keane became the first player to win the award more than once32

Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join The Football League in 1893 and they reached the First Division in 1904 Relegated only once in 1913 they continue the longest streak in the top division3 and have won the secondmost topflight matches in English football history4 In the 1930s Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war In 1970–71 they won their first League and FA Cup Double Between 1989 and 2005 they won five League titles and five FA Cups including two more Doubles They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position5
Herbert Chapman won Arsenals first national trophies but died prematurely He helped introduce the WM formation floodlights and shirt numbers6 and added the white sleeves and brighter red to the clubs kit Arsène Wenger was the longestserving manager and won the most trophies He won a record 7 FA Cups and his titlewinning team set an English record for the longest topflight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 20047 receiving the nickname The Invincibles
In 1886 Woolwich munitions workers founded the club as Dial Square In 1913 the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury becoming close neighbours of Tottenham Hotspur and creating the North London derby In 2006 they moved to the nearby Emirates Stadium In terms of revenue Arsenal is the ninth highestearning football club in the world earned €4876m in 2016–17 season8 Based on social media activity from 2014 to 2015 Arsenals fanbase is the fifth largest in the world8 In 2018 Forbes estimated the club was the third most valuable in England with the club being worth 224 billion9
In October 1886 Scotsman David Danskin and his fellow 15 munitions workers in Woolwich now South East London formed Arsenal as Dial Square with each member contributing sixpence and Danskin adding another three shillings to help form the club1a Named after the heart of the Royal Arsenal complex they took the name of the whole complex a month later1312 Royal Arsenal FCs first home was Plumstead Common12 though they spent most of their time in South East London playing on the other side of Plumstead at the Manor Ground Royal Arsenal won Arsenals first trophies in 1890 and 1891 and these were the only football association trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London1415 In 1891 Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional16
Royal Arsenal renamed themselves for a second time upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893 They registered their new name Woolwich Arsenal with The Football League when the club ascended later that year1718 Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of The Football League starting out in the Second Division and winning promotion to the First Division in 1904 Falling attendances due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city led the club close to bankruptcy by 19101920 Businessmen Henry Norris and William Hall became involved in the club and sought to move them elsewhere2122
In 1913 soon after relegation back to the Second Division Woolwich Arsenal moved to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury North London This saw their third change of name the following year they reduced Woolwich Arsenal to simply The Arsenal2324 In 1919 The Football League voted to promote The Arsenal instead of relegated local rivals Tottenham Hotspur into the newly enlarged First Division despite only listing the club sixth in the Second Divisions last prewar season of 1914–15 Some books have speculated that the club won this election to division one by dubious meansb Later that year The Arsenal started dropping The in official documents gradually shifting its name for the final time towards Arsenal as it is generally known today28
With a new home and First Division football attendances were more than double those at the Manor Ground and Arsenals budget grew rapidly2930 Their location and recordbreaking salary offer lured star Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman in 19253132 Over the next five years Chapman built a new Arsenal He appointed enduring new trainer Tom Whittaker33 implemented Charlie Buchans new twist on the nascent WM formation3435 captured young players like Cliff Bastin and Eddie Hapgood and lavished Highburys income on stars like David Jack and Alex James With recordbreaking spending and gate receipts Arsenal quickly became known as the Bank of England club3637
Transformed Chapmans Arsenal claimed their first national trophy the FA Cup in 1930 Two League Championships followed in 1930–31 and 1932–3338 Chapman also presided over multiple off the pitch changes white sleeves and shirt numbers were added to the kitc a Tube station was named after the club4243 and the first of two opulent Art Deco stands was completed with some of the first floodlights in English football30 Suddenly in the middle of the 1933–34 season Chapman died of pneumonia44 His work was left to Joe Shaw and George Allison who saw out a hattrick with the 1933–34 and 1934–35 titles and then won the 1936 FA Cup and 1937–38 title
World War II meant The Football League was suspended for seven years but Arsenal returned to win it in the second postwar season 1947–48 This was Tom Whittakers first season as manager after his promotion to succeed Allison and the club had equalled the champions of England record They won a third FA Cup in 1950 and then won a recordbreaking seventh championship in 1952–5345 However the war had taken its toll on Arsenal The club had had more players killed than any top flight club46 and debt from reconstructing the North Bank Stand bled Arsenals resources3024
Arsenal were not to win the League or the FA Cup for another 18 years The 53 Champions squad was old and the club failed to attract strong enough replacements47 Although Arsenal were competitive during these years their fortunes had waned the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in midleague mediocrity48 Even former England captain Billy Wright could not bring the club any success as manager in a stint between 1962 and 196649

The club metamorphosed during the long tenure of manager Arsène Wenger appointed in 1996 New attacking football61 an overhaul of dietary and fitness practicese and efficiency with moneyf have defined his reign Accumulating key players from Wengers homeland such as Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry Arsenal won a second League and Cup double in 1997–98 and a third in 2001–02 In addition the club reached the final of the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup were victorious in the 2003 and 2005 FA Cups and won the Premier League in 2003–04 without losing a single match an achievement which earned the side the nickname The Invincibles70 This latter feat came within a run of 49 league matches unbeaten from 7 May 2003 to 24 October 2004 a national record71
Arsenal finished in either first or second place in the league in eight of Wengers first nine seasons at the club although on no occasion were they able to retain the title72 The club had never progressed beyond the quarterfinals of the Champions League until 2005–06 in that season they became the first club from London in the competitions fiftyyear history to reach the final in which they were beaten 2–1 by Barcelona73 In July 2006 they moved into the Emirates Stadium after 93 years at Highbury74 Arsenal reached the final of the 2007 and 2011 League Cups losing 2–1 to Chelsea and Birmingham City respectively

Arsenals first crest from 1888
The monogram badge as used in the 1930 FA Cup Final
The Art Deco badge
A version of the Arsenal crest used from 1949 to 2002
Unveiled in 1888 Royal Arsenals first crest featured three cannons viewed from above pointing northwards similar to the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich nowadays transferred to the coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys but the presence of a carved lions head and a cascabel on each are clear indicators that they are cannons91 This was dropped after the move to Highbury in 1913 only to be reinstated in 1922 when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon pointing eastwards with the clubs nickname The Gunners inscribed alongside it this crest only lasted until 1925 when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down91
In 1949 the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon below the clubs name set in blackletter and above the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington and a scroll inscribed with the clubs newly adopted Latin motto Victoria Concordia Crescit  victory comes from harmony – coined by the clubs programme editor Harry Homer91 For the first time the crest was rendered in colour which varied slightly over the crests lifespan finally becoming red gold and green Because of the numerous revisions of the crest Arsenal were unable to copyright it Although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark and had fought and eventually won a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold unofficial Arsenal merchandise92 Arsenal eventually sought a more comprehensive legal protection Therefore in 2002 they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style which was copyrightable93 The cannon once again faces east and the clubs name is written in a sansserif typeface above the cannon Green was replaced by dark blue The new crest was criticised by some supporters the Arsenal Independent Supporters Association claimed that the club had ignored much of Arsenals history and tradition with such a radical modern design and that fans had not been properly consulted on the issue94 Until the 1960s a badge was worn on the playing shirt only for highprofile matches such as FA Cup finals usually in the form of a monogram of the clubs initials in red on a white background95
The monogram theme was developed into an Art Decostyle badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F the whole set within a hexagonal border This early example of a corporate logo introduced as part of Herbert Chapmans rebranding of the club in the 1930s was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors96 From 1967 a white cannon was regularly worn on the shirts until replaced by the club crest sometimes with the addition of the nickname The Gunners in the 1990s95
In the 2011–12 season Arsenal celebrated their 125th anniversary The celebrations included a modified version of the current crest worn on their jerseys for the season The crest was all white surrounded by 15 oak leaves to the right and 15 laurel leaves to the left The oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the Royal Oak pub The 15 laurel leaves represent the design detail on the six pence pieces paid by the founding fathers to establish the club The laurel leaves also represent strength To complete the crest 1886 and 2011 are shown on either sides of the motto Forward at the bottom of the crest97
For much of Arsenals history their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts though this has not always been the case The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest soon after Arsenals foundation in 1886 Two of Dial Squares founding members Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work As they put together the first team in the area no kit could be found so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball98 The shirt was redcurrant a dark shade of red and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops99100 In 1933 Herbert Chapman wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed updated the kit adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster with whom Chapman played golf101 Regardless of which story is true the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since aside from two seasons The first was 1966–67 when Arsenal wore allred shirts100 this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season The second was 2005–06 the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913 their first season in the stadium the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season101 In the 2008–09 season Arsenal replaced the traditional allwhite sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe100
Arsenals home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs In 1909 Sparta Prague adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time101 in 1938 Hibernian adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip102 In 1941 Luis Robledo an Englandschooled founder of Santa Fe and a fan of Arsenal selected the main colors for his newly created team In 1920 Sporting Clube de Bragas manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his teams green kit to a duplicate of Arsenals red with white sleeves and shorts giving rise to the teams nickname of Os Arsenalistas103 These teams still wear those designs to this day
For many years Arsenals away colours were white or navy blue However in 1968 the FA banned navy shirts they looked too similar to referees black kit so in the 1969–70 season Arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts This kit was worn in the 1971 FA Cup Final as Arsenal beat Liverpool to secure the double for the first time in their history The yellow and blue strip became almost as famous as their iconic red and white home kit104105 Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again the following year wearing the red and white home strip and were beaten by Leeds United Arsenal then competed in three consecutive FA Cup finals between 1978 and 1980 wearing their lucky yellow and blue strip104 which remained the clubs away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in 1982–83 The following season Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme albeit with a darker shade of blue than before
When Nike took over from Adidas as Arsenals kit provider in 1994 Arsenals away colours were again changed to twotone blue shirts and shorts Since the advent of the lucrative replica kit market the away kits have been changed regularly with Arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits During this period the designs have been either all blue designs or variations on the traditional yellow and blue such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001–02 season the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007 and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013106 Until 2014 the away kit was changed every season and the outgoing away kit became the thirdchoice kit if a new home kit was being introduced in the same year107 Since Puma began manufacturing Arsenals kits in 2014 new home away and third kits are released every single season108 From the 2019–20 season Arsenals kits will be manufactured by Adidas109


Before joining the Football League Arsenal played briefly on Plumstead Common then at the Manor Ground in Plumstead then spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby Invicta Ground Upon joining the Football League in 1893 the club returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and terracing upgrading it from just a field Arsenal continued to play their home games there for the next twenty years with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season until the move to north London in 1913113114
Widely referred to as Highbury Arsenal Stadium was the clubs home from September 1913 until May 2006 The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect Archibald Leitch and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time with a single covered stand and three openair banks of terracing30 The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s new Art Deco West and East stands were constructed opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 195430
Highbury could hold more than 60000 spectators at its peak and had a capacity of 57000 until the early 1990s The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an allseater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season thus reducing the capacity to 38419 seated spectators115 This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards so much so that for two seasons from 1998 to 2000 Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley which could house more than 70000 spectators116
Expansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II listed building and the other three stands were close to residential properties30 These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time117 After considering various options in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60361capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove since named the Emirates Stadium about 500 metres southwest of Highbury118 The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs119 and construction was completed in July 2006 in time for the start of the 2006–07 season120 The stadium was named after its sponsors the airline company Emirates with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history worth around £100 million121 Some fans referred to the ground as Ashburton Grove or the Grove as they did not agree with corporate sponsorship of stadium names122 The stadium will be officially known as Emirates Stadium until at least 2028 and the airline will be the clubs shirt sponsor until at least 2024123124 From the start of the 2010–11 season on the stands of the stadium have been officially known as North Bank East Stand West Stand and Clock end125

The club crest is derived from the Manchester City Council coat of arms although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail81 The devil stems from the clubs nickname The Red Devils it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s and incorporated into the club crest in 1970 although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 197181
Newton Heaths uniform in 1879 four years before the club played its first competitive match has been documented as white with blue cord82 A photograph of the Newton Heath team taken in 1892 is believed to show the players wearing redandwhite quartered jerseys and navy blue knickerbockers83 Between 1894 and 1896 the players wore green and gold jerseys83 which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts which were worn with navy blue shorts83
After the name change in 1902 the club colours were changed to red shirts white shorts and black socks which has become the standard Manchester United home kit83 Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red V around the neck similar to the shirt worn in the 1909 FA Cup Final They remained part of their home kits until 192783 For a period in 1934 the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the clubs lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change83 The black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965 where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971 with white used on occasion when the club reverted to black Black shorts and white socks are sometimes worn with the home strip most often in away games if there is a clash with the opponents kit For 2018–19 black shorts and red socks became the primary choice for the home kit84 Since 1997–98 white socks have been the preferred choice for European games which are typically played on weeknights to aid with player visibility85 The current home kit is a red shirt with the trademark Adidas three stripes in red on the shoulders white shorts and black socks86
The Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt black shorts and white socks but there have been several exceptions These include an allblack strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995 the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 1999–2000 season87 and the 2011–12 away kit which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes with black shorts and blue socks88 An allgrey away kit worn during the 1995–96 season was dropped after just five games in its final outing against Southampton Alex Ferguson instructed the team to change into the third kit during halftime The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their teammates against the crowd United failed to win a competitive game in the kit89 In 2001 to celebrate 100 years as Manchester United a reversible white and gold away kit was released although the actual match day shirts were not reversible90
The clubs third kit is often allblue this was most recently the case during the 2014–15 season91 Exceptions include a greenandgold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994 a blueandwhite striped shirt worn during the 1994–95 and 1995–96 seasons and once in 1996–97 an allblack kit worn during the Treblewinning 1998–99 season and a white shirt with blackandred horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003–04 and 2005–0692 From 2006–07 to 2013–14 the third kit was the previous seasons away kit albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 2006–07 and 2010–11 apart from 2008–09 when an allblue kit was launched to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1967–68 European Cup success93
Newton Heath initially played on a field on North Road close to the railway yard the original capacity was about 12000 but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League94 Some expansion took place in 1887 and in 1891 Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands each able to hold 1000 spectators95 Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road the highest documented attendance was approximately 15000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 189396 A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 188997
In June 1893 after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners Manchester Deans and Canons who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground secretary A H Albut procured the use of the Bank Street ground in Clayton98 It initially had no stands by the start of the 1893–94 season two had been built one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the Bradford end At the opposite end the Clayton end the ground had been built up thousands thus being provided for98 Newton Heaths first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893 when 10000 people saw Alf Farman score a hattrick Newton Heaths only goals in a 3–2 win The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later98 In October 1895 before the visit of Manchester City the club purchased a 2000capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club and put up another stand on the reserved side as distinct from the popular side However weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 1200099
When the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902 club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the clubs next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham100 Following financial investment new club president John Henry Davies paid £500 for the erection of a new 1000seat stand at Bank Street101 Within four years the stadium had cover on all four sides as well as the ability to hold approximately 50000 spectators some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand101
Following Manchester Uniteds first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies ambition101 in February 1909 six weeks before the clubs first FA Cup title Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United following the purchase of land for around £60000 Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £30000 for construction original plans called for seating capacity of 100000 though budget constraints forced a revision to 77000 The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester The stadiums record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939 when an FA Cup semifinal between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76962 spectators102
Bombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter After the war the club received compensation from the War Damage Commission in the amount of £22278 While reconstruction took place the team played its home games at Manchester Citys Maine Road ground Manchester United was charged £5000 per year plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts103 Later improvements included the addition of roofs first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans views and they were eventually replaced with a cantilevered structure The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof completed in time for the 1993–94 season36 First used on 25 March 1957 and costing £40000 four 180foot 55 m pylons were erected each housing 54 individual floodlights These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand which remains in use today104
The Taylor Reports requirement for an allseater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44000 by 1993 In 1995 the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers restoring capacity to approximately 55000 At the end of the 1998–99 season second tiers were added to the East and West Stands raising capacity to around 67000 and between July 2005 and May 2006 8000 more seats were added via second tiers in the northwest and northeast quadrants Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006 when an attendance of 69070 became a new Premier League record105 The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007 when 76098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers 4–1 with just 114 seats 015 per cent of the total capacity of 76212 unoccupied106 In 2009 reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75957107108 Manchester United has the second highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund109110111
Manchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world with one of the highest average home attendances in Europe112 The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club MUSC in at least 24 countries113 The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants Deloitte estimate that Manchester United has 75 million fans worldwide15 The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams after Barcelona and Real Madrid with over 73 million Facebook fans as of December 201916114 A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League115

Manchester United has rivalries with Arsenal Leeds United Liverpool and Manchester City against whom they contest the Manchester derby118119
The rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the Industrial Revolution when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port120 The two clubs are the most successful English teams in both domestic and international competitions and between them they have won 38 league titles 9 European Cups 4 UEFA Cups 5 UEFA Super Cups 19 FA Cups 13 League Cups 2 FIFA Club World Cups 1 Intercontinental Cup and 36 FA Community Shields5121122 It is considered to be one of the biggest rivalries in the football world and is considered the most famous fixture in English football123124125126127
The Roses Rivalry with Leeds stems from the Wars of the Roses fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire128
The rivalry with Arsenal arises from the numerous times the two teams as well as managers Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger have battled for the Premier League title With 33 titles between them 20 for Manchester United 13 for Arsenal this fixture has become known as one of the finest Premier League matchups in history129130
Manchester United has been described as a global brand a 2011 report by Brand Finance valued the clubs trademarks and associated intellectual property at £412 million – an increase of £39 million on the previous year valuing it at £11 million more than the second best brand Real Madrid – and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA Extremely Strong131 In July 2012 Manchester United was ranked first by Forbes magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands valuing the Manchester United brand at 223 billion132 The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League behind Real Madrid and Barcelona133 In January 2013 the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at 3 billion134 Forbes magazine valued the club at 33 billion – 12 billion higher than the next most valuable sports team134 They were overtaken by Real Madrid for the next four years but Manchester United returned to the top of the Forbes list in June 2017 with a valuation of 3689 billion135
The core strength of Manchester Uniteds global brand is often attributed to Matt Busbys rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster which drew worldwide acclaim117 The iconic team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles members of Englands World Cup winning team Denis Law and George Best The attacking style of play adopted by this team in contrast to the defensiveminded catenaccio approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era captured the imagination of the English footballing public136 Busbys team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s George Best known as the Fifth Beatle for his iconic haircut was the first footballer to significantly develop an offthefield media profile136
As the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991 the club raised significant capital with which it further developed its commercial strategy The clubs focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses137 The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense offthefield media attention to individual players most notably David Beckham who quickly developed his own global brand This attention often generates greater interest in onthefield activities and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure138 During his time with the club Beckhams popularity across Asia was integral to the clubs commercial success in that part of the world139

In an initial fiveyear deal worth £500000 Sharp Electronics became the clubs first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982–83 season a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999–2000 season when Vodafone agreed a fouryear £30 million deal142 Vodafone agreed to pay £36 million to extend the deal by four years but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League142

The clubs first kit manufacturer was Umbro until a fiveyear deal was agreed with Admiral Sportswear in 1975150 Adidas received the contract in 1980151 before Umbro started a second spell in 1992152 Umbros sponsorship lasted for ten years followed by Nikes recordbreaking £3029 million deal that lasted until 2015 38 million replica shirts were sold in the first 22 months with the company153154 In addition to Nike and Chevrolet the club also has several lowerlevel platinum sponsors including Aon and Budweiser155

Manchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 raising £67 million168 and received yet another takeover bid in 1998 this time from Rupert Murdochs British Sky Broadcasting Corporation This resulted in the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch – now the Manchester United Supporters Trust – who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any hostile takeover The Manchester United board accepted a £623 million offer169 but the takeover was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the final hurdle in April 1999170 A few years later a power struggle emerged between the clubs manager Alex Ferguson and his horseracing partners John Magnier and J P McManus who had gradually become the majority shareholders In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmens majority171
In May 2005 Malcolm Glazer purchased the 287 per cent stake held by McManus and Magnier thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately £800 million then approx 15 billion172 Once the purchase was complete the club was taken off the stock exchange173 In July 2006 the club announced a £660 million debt refinancing package resulting in a 30 per cent reduction in annual interest payments to £62 million a year174175 In January 2010 with debts of £7165 million 117 billion176 Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth £504 million enabling them to pay off most of the £509 million owed to international banks177 The annual interest payable on the bonds – which were to mature on 1 February 2017 – is approximately £45 million per annum178 Despite restructuring the clubs debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010 at Old Trafford and the clubs Trafford Training Centre179180 Supporter groups encouraged matchgoing fans to wear green and gold the colours of Newton Heath On 30 January reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans dubbed the Red Knights with plans to buying out the Glazers controlling interest181

Houllier was replaced by Rafael Benítez at the end of the 2003–04 season Despite finishing fifth in Benítezs first season Liverpool won the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League beating AC Milan 3–2 in a penalty shootout after the match ended with a score of 3–333 The following season Liverpool finished third in the Premier League and won the 2006 FA Cup Final beating West Ham United in a penalty shootout after the match finished 3–334 American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks became the owners of the club during the 2006–07 season in a deal which valued the club and its outstanding debts at £2189 million35 The club reached the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final against Milan as it had in 2005 but lost 2–136 During the 2008–09 season Liverpool achieved 86 points its highest Premier League points total and finished as runners up to Manchester United37
In the 2009–10 season Liverpool finished seventh in the Premier League and failed to qualify for the Champions League Benítez subsequently left by mutual consent38 and was replaced by Fulham manager Roy Hodgson39 At the start of the 2010–11 season Liverpool was on the verge of bankruptcy and the clubs creditors asked the High Court to allow the sale of the club overruling the wishes of Hicks and Gillett John W Henry owner of the Boston Red Sox and of Fenway Sports Group bid successfully for the club and took ownership in October 201040 Poor results during the start of that season led to Hodgson leaving the club by mutual consent and former player and manager Kenny Dalglish taking over41 In the 2011–12 season Liverpool secured a record 8th League Cup success and reached the FA Cup final but finished in eighth position the worst league finish in 18 years this led to the sacking of Dalglish4243 He was replaced by Brendan Rodgers44 whose Liverpool team in the 2013–14 season mounted an unexpected title charge to finish second behind champions Manchester City and subsequently return to the Champions League scoring 101 goals in the process the most since the 106 scored in the 1895–96 season4546 Following a disappointing 2014–15 season where Liverpool finished sixth in the league and a poor start to the following campaign Rodgers was sacked in October 201547

For much of Liverpools history its home colours have been all red but when the club was founded its kit was more like the contemporary Everton kit The blue and white quartered shirts were used until 1894 when the club adopted the citys colour of red7 The citys symbol of the liver bird was adopted as the clubs badge in 1901 although it was not incorporated into the kit until 1955 Liverpool continued to wear red shirts and white shorts until 1964 when manager Bill Shankly decided to change to an all red strip54 Liverpool played in all red for the first time against Anderlecht as Ian St John recalled in his autobiography
He Shankly thought the colour scheme would carry psychological impact – red for danger red for power He came into the dressing room one day and threw a pair of red shorts to Ronnie Yeats Get into those shorts and lets see how you look he said Christ Ronnie you look awesome terrifying You look 7 ft tall Why not go the whole hog boss I suggested Why not wear red socks Lets go out all in red Shankly approved and an iconic kit was born55
The Liverpool away strip has more often than not been all yellow or white shirts and black shorts but there have been several exceptions An all grey kit was introduced in 1987 which was used until the 1991–92 centenary season when it was replaced by a combination of green shirts and white shorts After various colour combinations in the 1990s including gold and navy bright yellow black and grey and ecru the club alternated between yellow and white away kits until the 2008–09 season when it reintroduced the grey kit A third kit is designed for European away matches though it is also worn in domestic away matches on occasions when the current away kit clashes with a teams home kit Between 2012 and 2015 the kits were designed by Warrior Sports who became the clubs kit providers at the start of the 2012–13 season56 In February 2015 Warriors parent company New Balance announced it would be entering the global football market with teams sponsored by Warrior now being outfitted by New Balance57 The only other branded shirts worn by the club were made by Umbro until 1985 when they were replaced by Adidas who produced the kits until 1996 when Reebok took over They produced the kits for 10 years before Adidas made the kits from 2006 to 201258 Nike will become the club’s official kit supplier from the 2020–21 season59
Liverpool was the first English professional club to have a sponsors logo on its shirts after agreeing a deal with Hitachi in 197960 Since then the club has been sponsored by Crown Paints Candy Carlsberg and Standard Chartered The contract with Carlsberg which was signed in 1992 was the longestlasting agreement in English topflight football61 The association with Carlsberg ended at the start of the 2010–11 season when Standard Chartered Bank became the clubs sponsor62
The Liverpool badge is based on the citys liver bird which in the past had been placed inside a shield In 1992 to commemorate the centennial of the club a new badge was commissioned including a representation of the Shankly Gates The next year twin flames were added at either side symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield where an eternal flame burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster63 In 2012 Warrior Sports first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough64
Anfield was built in 1884 on land adjacent to Stanley Park Situated 2 miles 3 km from Liverpool city centre it was originally used by Everton before the club moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding65 Left with an empty ground Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since The capacity of the stadium at the time was 20000 although only 100 spectators attended Liverpools first match at Anfield66
The Kop was built in 1906 due to the high turnout for matches and was called the Oakfield Road Embankment initially Its first game was on 1 September 1906 when the home side beat Stoke City 1–067 In 1906 the banked stand at one end of the ground was formally renamed the Spion Kop after a hill in KwaZuluNatal68 The hill was the site of the Battle of Spion Kop in the Second Boer War where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment died many of them from Liverpool69 At its peak the stand could hold 28000 spectators and was one of the largest singletier stands in the world Many stadiums in England had stands named after Spion Kop but Anfields was the largest of them at the time it could hold more supporters than some entire football grounds70
Anfield could accommodate more than 60000 supporters at its peak and had a capacity of 55000 until the 1990s when following recommendations from the Taylor Report all clubs in the Premier League were obliged to convert to allseater stadiums in time for the 1993–94 season reducing its capacity to 4527671 The findings of the report precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand which was rebuilt in 1992 coinciding with the centenary of the club and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998 which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported at the start of the 1999–2000 season72
Because of restrictions on expanding the capacity at Anfield Liverpool announced plans to move to the proposed Stanley Park Stadium in May 200273 Planning permission was granted in July 200474 and in September 2006 Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool a 999year lease on the proposed site75 Following the takeover of the club by George Gillett and Tom Hicks in February 2007 the proposed stadium was redesigned The new design was approved by the Council in November 2007 The stadium was scheduled to open in August 2011 and would hold 60000 spectators with HKS Inc contracted to build the stadium76 Construction was halted in August 2008 as Gillett and Hicks had difficulty in financing the £300 million needed for the development77 In October 2012 BBC Sport reported that Fenway Sports Group the new owners of Liverpool FC had decided to redevelop their current home at Anfield stadium rather than building a new stadium in Stanley Park As part of the redevelopment the capacity of Anfield was to increase from 45276 to approximately 60000 and would cost approximately £150m78 When construction was completed on the new Main stand the capacity of Anfield was increased to 54074 This £100 million expansion added a third tier to the stand This was all part of a £260 million project to improve the Anfield area Jurgen Klopp the manager at the time described the stand as impressive79
Liverpool is one of the best supported clubs in the world580 The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised Supporters Clubs in at least 50 countries Notable groups include Spirit of Shankly81 The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours82 which has included playing in front of 101000 in Michigan US and 95000 in Melbourne Australia8384 Liverpool fans often refer to themselves as Kopites a reference to the fans who once stood and now sit on the Kop at Anfield85 In 2008 a group of fans decided to form a splinter club AFC Liverpool to play matches for fans who had been priced out of watching Premier League football86
The song Youll Never Walk Alone originally from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel and later recorded by Liverpool musicians Gerry and the Pacemakers is the clubs anthem and has been sung by the Anfield crowd since the early 1960s87 It has since gained popularity among fans of other clubs around the world88 The songs title adorns the top of the Shankly Gates which were unveiled on 2 August 1982 in memory of former manager Bill Shankly The Youll Never Walk Alone portion of the Shankly Gates is also reproduced on the clubs crest89
The clubs supporters have been involved in two stadium disasters The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster in which 39 Juventus supporters were killed They were confined to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse UEFA laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters90 and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years Liverpool was banned for an additional year preventing it from participating in the 1990–91 European Cup even though it won the League in 199091 Twentyseven fans were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and were extradited to Belgium in 1987 to face trial92 In 1989 after a fivemonth trial in Belgium 14 Liverpool fans were given threeyear sentences for involuntary manslaughter93 half of the terms were suspended94
The second disaster took place during an FA Cup semifinal between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium Sheffield on 15 April 1989 Ninetysix Liverpool fans died as a consequence of overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster In the following days The Sun newspaper published an article entitled The Truth in which it claimed that Liverpool fans had robbed the dead and had urinated on and attacked the police95 Subsequent investigations proved the allegations false leading to a boycott of the newspaper by Liverpool fans across the city and elsewhere many still refuse to buy The Sun 30 years later96 Many support organisations were set up in the wake of the disaster such as the Hillsborough Justice Campaign which represents bereaved families survivors and supporters in their efforts to secure justice97
Liverpools longestestablished rivalry is with fellow Liverpool team Everton against whom they contest the Merseyside derby The rivalry stems from Liverpools formation and the dispute with Everton officials and the then owners of Anfield98 The Merseyside derby is one of the few local derbies which do not enforce fan segregation and hence has been known as the friendly derby99 Since the mid1980s the rivalry has intensified both on and off the field and since the inception of the Premier League in 1992 the Merseyside derby has had more players sent off than any other Premier League game It has been referred to as the most illdisciplined and explosive fixture in the Premier League100 In terms of support within the city the number of Liverpool fans outweigh Everton supporters by a ratio of 21101
